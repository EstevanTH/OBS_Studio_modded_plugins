# OBS Studio: Modded plugins
Here are my plugin modifications that could not be merged to OBS Studio, because they could not be merged or because they have nothing to do in official releases of OBS Studio.

[Link to OBS Studio's official repository](https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/)

**Disclaimer:** Neither me or [jp9000](https://github.com/jp9000) have bad intentions. I may look like I am in a conflict with him, but the only problem is that my feelings are harsh to my mind. Posting new features to a program is not always acceptable, I think I can live with that. I am still okay to fix problems on the official repository.

## Contents
### vlc-video
My release of the module `vlc-video` features:
- **VLC deinterlace**: ability to select the VLC deinterlace method.
- **Media options**: possibility to append media options to the path / URL / MRL. You can put `"` quotes to force the parser to understand that something is one-piece (quotes removed after parsing), and they can be escaped `\"` if you really need such quotes in arguments.

## Additional information
As this is my repository, here are some guidelines:
- I do not accept other's pull requests.
- I only compile on Windows.
- I am free to use my own coding style here, because it's easier for me to read.
- If you want to compile, please copy my files into your local repository copy of OBS Studio and follow [Install Instructions](https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/wiki/install-instructions).
- Any insult will get you banned. I respect, you respect.
- If you do not want to be my friend, may you be free to go. Otherwise you are free to add `Mohamed_RACHID` on [Twitch (aka Curse)](https://app.twitch.tv/).
